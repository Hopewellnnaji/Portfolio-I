<h1>About Me</h1>

        <p>Well, I guess most biographies start off with the nomenclature intel. 
          You perhaps, could already guess my name, by just a glance at my ever first website, build solely off Hypertext Markup Language. 
          Just for the purose of emphasis, I am Hopewell Chibuikem Nnaji, and it is a pleasure to meet you. I was born on the 16th of August, 1996, into a christian family, in Nigeria.
          I am innately Igbo, and currently on a mission to speak English, French, German and Spanish fluently. 
          It may interest you to know that I am a Pharmacist by profession, trained and currently practicing as a retail Pharmacist in Nigeria.
          I love reading, swimming, playing bass guitar and chess.</p>
